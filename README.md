# Sleep Health and Lifestyle

Sleep health is a crucial component of overall well-being in adults, linked with various lifestyle factors. This study analyzes a synthetic dataset from keggle to investigate the interrelations between sleep patterns and lifestyle influences without compromising individual privacy. The dataset encompasses variables such as sleep duration, quality, disorders, physical activity levels, stress, and cardiovascular health, providing a foundation for analysis. Employing correlation testing and visual heatmap methodologies, we uncover significant associations, particularly between sleep quality, stress levels, and heart rate â€” factors that correlate strongly with cardiovascular health outcomes. The findings suggest that sleep quality is inversely affected by stress, while physical activity exhibits a nuanced but positive correlation with sleep health. With the mounting evidence linking sleep to health problems, it is paramount that we shift our focus to perceive sleep not merely as an inactive state, but as an essential activity for maintaining overall health.
